    <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
    <p id="desc">In the heart of Ravenbrook, a small town shrouded in an eternal night, stands an ancient library known as the
        Obsidian Archives. Legend has it that the library harbors a dark secret — a forbidden knowledge that has been
        hidden away for centuries. The townsfolk avoid the place, claiming that the library is haunted by the whispers
        of the past.<br><br>
        You, a daring adventurer with a penchant for unraveling mysteries, find yourself drawn to the ominous allure of
        the Obsidian Archives. One stormy night, seeking refuge from the rain, you step inside, and the heavy door
        creaks closed behind you, trapping you in a dimly lit labyrinth of dusty shelves.<br><br>
        As you explore the library, you come across a tablet left on a weathered table. It flickers to life, displaying
        a message from a previous visitor, a researcher named Professor Evelyn Blackwell. She had come in search of a
        fabled artifact, said to hold the power to control shadows. However, she warns that unlocking this power comes
        at a perilous cost.<br><br>
        Before Professor Blackwell could complete her warning, a malevolent force descended upon the library, plunging
        it into darkness. The tablet is now your only source of light and guidance. To escape, you must follow in
        Professor Blackwell's footsteps, solving puzzles and deciphering cryptic messages she left behind.<br><br>
        The tablet, your only lifeline in this eerie quest, holds the key to unlocking the ancient magic that binds you
        to the library. Can you solve the puzzles, navigate the shadows, and escape the clutches of the Obsidian
        Archives before the night becomes your eternal prison?
