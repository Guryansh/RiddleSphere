        <p class="name-ask">Alright, imagine you're at a never-ending carnival ride called Modular Arithmetic Land!
In this crazy land, numbers follow a special rule: they always go in circles!
Let's say we're on a Ferris wheel that has 12 seats. When it goes around, it counts from 1 to 12. But here's the twist: once it reaches 12, it starts back at 1! It's like a looping roller coaster for numbers!
That's modular arithmetic for you! It's like doing math in a magical world where numbers can't go beyond a certain limit. They keep looping around, having a wild time on their numerical journey.
So, when you see something like "15 modulo 12," it means you're asking, "Which seat would the number 15 be on the Ferris wheel?"
Since the Ferris wheel has only 12 seats, the answer is seat number 3!
Modular arithmetic helps us find these "magical seats" where numbers end up when they go on their looping adventures. It's a playful way to understand how numbers behave in their own amusement park!
Now hop on the ride and enjoy the mathematical madness of modular arithmetic!
In python "%" is used for mod</p>
